<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Coloring is a new favorite for Joanna. &nbsp;My original plan was to just try and use it to keep her entertained (and still) during church. <p />But when she found her notebook this morning and kept signing &quot;please&quot; I just couldn&#39;t resist. The high chair is helping het have a surface and keep the color contained to one place. <p />A small desk or table may be in our near future :)<p /></span></p></div>
