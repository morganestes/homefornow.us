<p>I think it could be fun to share a few of those lessons that I&rsquo;ve learned through my 14 Let&rsquo;s Start Talking mission projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first heard about LST in 1993 as a freshman at Pepperdine I thought &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to do that, but no way, I have to go home and work and see my family, I couldn&rsquo;t spend half the summer overseas.&rdquo; It sounded like a neat idea, but just not right for me at the time.&nbsp; Then, a couple years later one of the guys in my small group Bible study asked our group to pray for their project, they needed 1 more person to join them as the church there had requested 4 and at that time they only had 3. After a couple of weeks of this, I thought &ldquo;maybe I can be that 4<sup>th</sup> person.&rdquo; We talked about it and worked it out!&nbsp; We did a special weekend of training together to get me caught up on what I&rsquo;d missed and we kept on going with the training to get ready to go.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t sure how the whole fundraising thing would work, especially since I started late. One part of that first experience really sticks out; a family at church asked how my fundraising was going and when they heard I was about half way there and coming up to a deadline they stepped in and helped finish it up. What a great blessing to me and reminder that God really does provide when we ask!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are so many different things I&rsquo;ve learned, I think instead of cramming it all in here I&rsquo;ll try &amp; do a quick summary about each project in a separate post. Maybe I&rsquo;ll wait till we get our pictures out of storage so I can scan and include a picture with them, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For today, here&rsquo;s a list of all the projects, just so I can keep them straight&hellip;</p>
