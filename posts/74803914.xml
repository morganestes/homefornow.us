	<content:encoded><![CDATA[A trip to the pediatrician resulted in Joanna being diagnosed with jaundice and being prescribed phototherapy. This meant she had to stay under lights all day except when being fed or having her diaper changed. <p /> It was tough having to put her in a box of lights basically all the time and having to wrap her in a belt of light when she was eating. <p /> We were so glad to find out from the home health nurse today that her level has dropped and we could stop the light treatment! <p /> We took her out, dresses her, and cuddled with her. It was great!<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
