	<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes it's fun to have a tradition, and Morgan and I have developed one over the last couple of years, Red Lobster for lunch on Sunday! <p /> I think it started when we were trying to eat healthier. I found out I liked tilapia by trying it on the school cafeteria, I figured if I liked it there it was worth trying at a retaraunt. The tradition continued with some great gift cards from family! <p /> At our healthiest we were sharing a grilled tilapia and adding a salad.<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
