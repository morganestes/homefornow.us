	<content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this week I had an early breakfast with a friend at Colby's Grill. (Side note: that place is GREAT for breakfast.). I had to get up and leave the house earlier than usual, so I didn't have time to make a lunch, and Jessica wasn't up to make it for me like she usually does. <p>I know, I'm spoiled. </p><p>As my friend and I were leaving from breakfast, I got a text from Jessica: "Your lunch is in the bed of the truck."</p><p>I read it and laughed, then went into a moment of confusion and panic. What did she mean? I didn't pack a lunch. But maybe I did and forgot. Did she make one and put it in there before I left, so I've been driving around with my lunch box just flopping around the truck?</p><p>Crazy, the things that pop in my mind at times like this. </p><p>No, the more exciting truth is that Jessica got up after I left, made me a lunch, drove to Colby's Grill, put my lunch in my truck, then went to work where she texted me that it was there. </p><p>Way cool. </p><p>A good breakfast, an even better lunch.</p>]]></content:encoded>
