</p>Usually when I get home from work or pick her up from the sitter's, Joanna grunts and speed crawls to me with a big smile on her face, but today she was already in her high chair having some dinner.<p>What greeting did she have for me tonight? A loud "Hi Daddy!" as I entered the kitchen! Jessica and I both heard it loud and clear and confirmed it with each other. It was a fun surprise to hear. <br />Considering her first clear word was "no!", repeated over and over in line at Homeland, this was a nice second.</p>]]></content:encoded>
