<p>We're teaching Joanna's class this quarter. That means 12 weeks of singing the same program to little ones - up to 10 little 8 & 9 month olds. While I already appreciated the men and women that teach the kiddos, I have a whole new respect for those who do it over and over again after just this one day. Today was our first day. It was so neat to watch our three little ones checking it all out, I'm looking forward to seeing them change and grow over the next few months. It was surprisingly exhausting even though all 3 kids did a great job. Yes, J is a bit removed from the other two. When I put her in the chair right next to the boy she promptly reached over and "caressed" his cheek, then his eye, so she got moved. Morgan did a great job carrying the singing while I searched for and helped distribute the props. Here's hoping the next eleven classes pass very quickly :) <p /> On a more serious note, I really appreciate the education ministry at MRCC, the leaders do a great job of providing good materials, starting right from the youngest class on up. Organizationally, they ask that parents teach a quarter per child that attends class. I think it's great that they expect us all to be involved. I'm looking forward to meeting more parents of Joanna's classmates, as these kids will be growing up together and it'll be neat to start forming those relationships now. - Jessica</p>]]></content:encoded>
