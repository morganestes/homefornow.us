<p>It was a bit of a rough day, after a series of long days getting the <br />house ready. Tonight was WoW at Memorial Road, but I just wasn't <br />feeling up to worship. I had a talk with a friend about work (he and I <br />share similar positions in different companies) and wasn't cheered up <br />too much. <p /> Then, things got better real fast. Six - count 'em: 6 - guys showed up <br />at our apartment to help move our heaviest furniture to our house. <br />After that, they all agreed to a second trip! Even though we're all <br />members at he same church, some of them had never met, so it was a <br />chance to bring them together as well. <p /> To top off the night, I looked in my closet and found two bundles of <br />freshly laundered and pressed dress shirts! <p /> Yep, life is good.</p></div>
