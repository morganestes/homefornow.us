<div class='post_body'>Starting Threads of Compassion OKC in January this year was a great move. I'm so glad Morgan encouraged me to do it! <p /> Yesterday was a work day for Threads and we had a great time in the afternoon working together. We learned new techniques from each other and enjoyed seeing the variety of styles. <p /> I look forward to next month's work day!<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
