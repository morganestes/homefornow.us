<div class='post_body'>There are 2 little tomatoes on my plant! I had begun to think we weren't going to get any tomatoes because of some yellow leaves and flowers that didn't become tomatoes. But, this morning there are 2 on this plant and one on our yellow plant. I look forward to eating them!<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
