<div class='post_body'>Recently our Sunday morning class asked for guys to help lead a service at Tealridge for this month. Since we're in town this holiday weekend Morgan signed up to help. <p /> Here he is before it began -we got there a bit early just to be sure we weren't late. <p /> I'm so thankful that I am married to a man who is so willing to help out when the church asks! <p /> It was a nice service, with some of our friends also helping. The residents at Tealridge were very appreciative. Being there reminded me of my Grandma Rita going so often to visit people living in homes. She sure was a good example of showing love to others.<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
