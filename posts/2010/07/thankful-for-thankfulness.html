<p>Jessica is blessed with the gift of encouragement, and one way that <br />she expresses it is through giving cards to folks. I'm not talking “go <br />to the grocery store and grab a card” cards, but thoughtfully written <br />cards for someone she's thinking of. In fact, we have an entire <br />dresser dedicated to cards and writing paraphernalia that we've <br />gathered through the years just for this purpose. <p /> Most recently, Jessica sat down to write thank you cards to the over <br />20 friends who helped us prepare our new house and get moved in. It <br />was great to take a few minutes to think about how each one if them <br />helped us out recently, and how great it is to be part of a church <br />family that is so willing to help others. <p /> Here's a shot of Jessica with 18 cards that she had just finished…and <br />there's still more to come!</p></div>
