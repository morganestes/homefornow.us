<div class='post_body'><p>WeWe  signed the contract on our first house in mid-March, then closed June 7th.  That sure felt like a long time, we waited so long because the previous owner's son was in school and they wanted to let him finish before moving.  We are in the process of painting the whole inside, so this video is a "before" one, to give an idea what it looked like before we started working in there.</p>
