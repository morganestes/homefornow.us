<div class='post_body'>Our laundry room is between the garage and kitchen. It's not much wider than a washing machine, but the light switch is on the wall just inside the garage. This means that when I go to do laundry I can't hit the light switch with my arms full of clothes. <p /> So, Morgan fixed it for me! (he's really good at that). <p /> Here is the original switch (that was on the "wrong" side of the room when I'm trying to do laundry.<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</p><p>And, here is the new motion detector switch! It doesn't matter that it's on the far side of the room because it turns on automatically when I walk toward it. So cool!</p><p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</p><p>Not only is it great when I'm doing laundry, but I'm looking forward to it lighting my way once I start parking in the garage. <p /> It's amazing what a good difference a $20 part and a handy husband can make! <p /> Jessica</p></div>
