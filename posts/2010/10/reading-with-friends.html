<p>A recent Saturday our friends invited us to join them at Barnes & Noble. Their daughter's school was having a fundraiser where the school got a percentage of the day's sales from customers who mentioned the school. We couldn't pass up a good excuse to browse for books, so we headed out there Saturday morning. Morgan is pictured with some of our sweet friends - various teachers from the school came and read children's stories. He joined in to listen with our friends. <p /> This particular family has been a great blessing to us - it's one of the great things about Oklahoma! -Jessica</p></div>
