<div class='post_body'>So, I often say that Morgan can fix anything. Tonight he proved my faith in his fix-it ability to be founded in reality yet again <p /> Here he is after fixing a DVD saga:<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</p><p>The DVD player that was connected to our TV hasn't been working right, it skips. This is kind of a big deal since we don't have cable and I'm working my way through the Gilmore Girls series on DVD. <p /> Tonight he heard the skipping and pulled out another player. It's one that we got free awhile back. Once it was connected we remembered why we haven't used it before - no remote came with it. A remote is essential to be able to watch various episodes on the disc. <p /> Using his phone Morgan was able to find the needed codes to program a remote we already had to work with this machine. It worked! <p /> Once again he fixed it! And, now my DVD watching can be back on track. <p /> Jessica</p></div>
