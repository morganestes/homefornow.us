<div class='post_body'>When we found out we were coming to CA for the CR Summit and that we'd have a free day at the end we started scheming about what we'd do with that day. There are lots of options, but Disney surfaced to the top, especially once we figured out we could go for free!<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</p><p>Our group spent a night at the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma helping after the ice storms last winter. It was a fun team bonding experience and made it so we could all come to Disneyland today for free! <p /> It's been a fun day. We took a break in the late afternoon for dinner and came back to ride a few more rides. <p /> Morgan and I have had a great time re-visiting our engagement spot. <p /> I'm glad for the volunteer day, for our friends, and for our day here today! <p /> Jessica</p></div>
