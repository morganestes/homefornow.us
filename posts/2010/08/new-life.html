<div class='post_body'>We have a flower at the corner that was tall and beautiful when it bloomed. Then it turned hard and gray. You can see the talk gray stalk in the photo, that used to be green with a pretty flower on top.<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</p><p>But, now there is new growth - the green is just visible at the bottom of the picture. <p /> I don't know yet if it will grow up to become a flower or nit, but I do see the hope of new life in it. I love that about plants, so often they look finished, but a little attention and water and they come back! <p /> I think people can be the same, there are times that we look finished, yet a little love goes a long way and we spring back!</p></div>
