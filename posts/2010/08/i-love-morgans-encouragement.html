<div class='post_body'>This photo is my foot, getting a much needed pedicure. <p /> One of the hard parts of Oklahoma has been how much more expensive this is here than it was in San Diego. Morgan seems to always notice specials for me and encourages me to go on and get one. Most of the time I just pass. <p /> But, tonight after another errand he totally encouraged me to come on in a new place and get one. He offered to run some other errands and get coffee while I'm here in the massaging chair getting my toes done. And, so far so good.<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
