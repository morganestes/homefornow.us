<p>This one was fun to make! It&rsquo;s for a friend and co-worker who loves Oklahoma Christian University, so I made it as close to the school colors as I could. It turned out great and their daughter looks real sweet in it. I love being able to make meaningful gifts for friends. It&rsquo;s also cool that I can pray for the baby &amp; my friends, the soon-to-be parents as I do the stitches. Crocheting has sure been fun for me!</p>
