<div class='post_body'>These are the 22 scarves that Threads of Compassion OKC gave to the YWCA last night. This brings our total to 130 scarves donated so far! <p /> It's been pretty neat to see this project grow this year. Our contact at rhe Y said that it has been really cool to see what an impact these are making when they give them to people. <p /> I'm thankful for all the help that I've had with this!<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
