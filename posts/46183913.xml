	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="WordSection1"><p>Morgan has made lots of nice improvements in the 9 months we&#8217;ve been in our house. We haven&#8217;t document all of them, but one that I did take before and after pictures of is the sink in our guest bathroom. While we&#8217;re not crazy about the green color in the countertop, it still works so that&#8217;s not a big problem. However, the original faucet was so close to the back wall of the sink that it was difficult for me (with my pretty small hands) to get a good hand-washing in there. So, for other adults it was just a pain. Morgan looked at it and said he could switch out the faucet for a new one that would extend further into the sink and be way better to use. He was right! After a quick trip to Home Depot we had a new faucet and he installed it. It&#8217;s way better than the old one.</p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Lucida Handwriting; color: navy;">Jessica </span></p><p></p></div><p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
