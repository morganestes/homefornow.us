</p>We received a cool 3 stage exersaucer as a gift for Joanna. I've been looking forward to moving on to stage 2, the one where she can sit in the middle and play with it.

It ends up that Joanna's height of 23 3/4 inches is just tall enough to use it. She seemed to enjoy her first time in.

The legs adjust to 2 more heights, so she should be able to use it for awhile, even as she gets taller.</p>]]></content:encoded>
