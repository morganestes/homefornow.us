	<content:encoded><![CDATA[This was quite a year to start a garden. Record heat, drought, pregnancy, a bulging disc and compressed nerve, and water rationing all presented some challenges for us. Then, once the temperature finally dropped below 100 vegetables started growing. Things were looking good then the weather turned again. There was a night or two were it dropped below freezing. After that we picked what was left and got the peppers pictured below. There were lots more little ones that are rotting on the plants. I tried a green and yellow one tonight. They were quite tasty! Here's hoping for better weather next year.<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
