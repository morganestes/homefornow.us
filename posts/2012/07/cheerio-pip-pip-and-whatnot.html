</p>In celebration of the Olympics in London, we decided to give Joanna some British-themed rings to chomp on.<p>Okay, that was a bit of a stretch. Really, we just gave her Cheerios for the first time. Once we made sure they weren't going to be a problem, I did what we usually do with firsts: shot video!</p><p>Since she was enjoying it so much, this one's a bit lengthy. Hope you enjoy it.</p></div>
