</p>We took part in OC's Trick or Treat Night tonight. For our first 5 years here I was responsible for two dorms of mostly college sophomores who participated in handing out candy to the children that came. It was always a crazy night - fun, but crazy. We usually had over 300 costumed kids come through. <p>Tonight we got to experience receiving the candy rather than handing it out. </p><p>Joanna was decked out in a ladybug costume we got from someone a while back. She grabbed her treat bucket (I got a happy meal at McDonald's for my lunch today so we'd have a bucket) and hung on to it the whole time as fun college students dropped in pieces of candy. </p><p>Just after taking the picture with our sweet friends from church she stood on her own for the longest things she has yet. Yes, she had a baby doll in one hand and a treat bucket in the other, but she just stood there as we looked on in amazement. </p><p>What a fun night seeing lots of friends from our time he on Edmond. It's fun being home here in Edmond and at OC.</p></div>
