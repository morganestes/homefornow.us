<div class='post_body'><p><br />One of the great things about being home at OC is the opportunity to enjoy things happening on campus.</p>
<p>I recently was able to enjoy a flute recital given by one our students, my friend Thomas. He did a great job!</p>
<p>I recorded most of his performance, I hope you enjoy it. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
