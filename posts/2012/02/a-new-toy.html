</p>We received a cool 3 stage exersaucer as a gift for Joanna. I've been looking forward to moving on to stage 2, the one where she can sit in the middle and play with it. The instructions say that stage begins at 4 months, and we're there now!  <p>Saturday Morgan spent just over an hour putting it all together for us. It ends up that Joanna's height of 23 3/4 inches is just tall enough to use it. She seemed to enjoy her first time in. I'm looking forward to watching her get more and more interested in it as she gets bigger. The legs adjust to 2 more heights, so she should be able to use it for awhile, even as she gets taller.</p></div>
