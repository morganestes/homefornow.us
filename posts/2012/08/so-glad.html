<p> <span style="font-family: Arial;">I am so glad my dad came to visit! &nbsp;When he heard me lamenting how crazy-busy things are right now he said he&#39;d check his schedule and see about coming to visit. <p />It worked out! His recent retirement made it so that he had the time available. How cool that he used it to come help us. <p />12 hours one way in his truck and a few hundred dollars of gas equal priceless times together. I&#39;m not sure if he or Joanna is having the better time. <p />What a blessing, thank you Dad for coming to visit!<p /></span></p></div>
