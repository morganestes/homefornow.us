<p> <span style="font-family: Arial;">We got to church a bit early since Morgan is helping run the sound board tonight. So we stopped by the kid&#39;s play room. J went right for the plane and started playing with controls. She seemed to love sitting in it. <p />We&#39;re headed to Indy later this week, so maybe she&#39;s just getting comfortable with the idea of flying. :)<p /></span></p></div>
