<p>We got up this morning and walked! For my birthday back in April I asked Morgan to get me a Nike + sensor so that I could use it with my iphone to keep track of workouts. It's been a great motivational tool. It got even better when we got one for Morgan too and he started walking with me. <p /> For several weeks we've been walking together 3 times a week. But the last couple of weeks that has slowed down some with so much of our energy going to getting the house ready. It was good to get back out there today and check out the walking trail right by our house!</p>]]></content:encoded>
