<div class='post_body'><p>Someone left us dinner on our porch this week! It's so cool that they were thinking of us. I've been amazed at how difficult it has been just to get a decent meal together with a newborn in the house. Though we don't know who dropped this by the house, it truly was a reminder that God provides in an amazing variety of ways and we've got it good here in Edmond. Thank you to whoever brought this by, it truly was appreciated.</p>
