<p>We (well, I along with approval from Morgan) decided to have a vegetable garden this year. It's been quite a story getting it started, but I'll save that for another day. This picture is some green beans that I started inside from seeds a friend gave me. I plan to move the plants out to the garden once it is warm enough. I planted them the evening of Thursday 3/31. This picture was taken this morning, so it's just a few hours shy of 2 weeks since planting the seeds. It's looking like we may have some fresh green beans to enjoy later this summer!</p></div>
