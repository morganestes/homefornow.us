<div class='post_body'>At lunch today Morgan and I decided to share the "fisherman's friend" lunch and add a 2nd salad. When we told the waitress that we wanted to share she said "I can do that, but, well do you want to get full, I'm not sure that will be enough". <p /> We assured her it would be fine. Being pregnant I eat often but not a lot at once. Also we each got a trip through the packed salad bar. <p /> As she walked away I told Morgsn that it would likely be a photo- worthy plate. And, I was right - it was a ton of food! We both ended up totally full and didn't even stuff our salad bowls as much as we could have. <p /> Just another big meal out to eat here in America!<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
