</p>Seven years ago today, I watched this beautiful woman walk towards me, surrounded by family and friends, and agreed to be my wife. We celebrated not just the start of our lives together, but also the birthdays of two dear women that we love. <p>Seven years later, I am still thrilled to see Jessica walking towards me. Then it was in a church; today it was in a restaurant in Missouri with "throwed rolls" flying around. Either place, it is still exciting for me. </p><p>I'm glad to say that not only do I love my wife, I really like her, and am looking forward to more years and more friends to celebrate them with.</p></div>
