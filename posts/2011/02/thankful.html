<div class='post_body'>We procrastinated on buying a shovel until a few hours before the storm hit. When Morgan got to Home Depot they were out. <p /> So, now that the snow has stopped and we want to clear the drive in case we have to go to work tomorrow we have a bit of a problem. <p /> We have a neighbor who goes to church with us. The only time we've called them prior to today was when we brought home a dresser we needed help unloading. The husband came right over and helped. <p /> So, today when we needed a shovel we made our 2nd call to this family. He once again graciously agreed to help, even leaving a friend's house around the corner to bring us the shovel. <p /> A few minutes later I heard scraping outside - he got here and just started right in clearing the driveway! <p /> Morgan quickly joined him.<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
