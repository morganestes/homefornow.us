<div class='post_body'><p>Joanna has quite a few toys already, some received at baby showers, and some at Christmas. She's just now getting to be able to hold on to things other than our fingers, so we're bringing out some of them for her. This turtle is part of a set received at Christmas. She seemed to enjoy hanging onto it tonight, and slobbering all over it.</p>
