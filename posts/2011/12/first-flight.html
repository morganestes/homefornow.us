</p>Thursday, December 1st was Joanna's first flight. We flew to Indy to be with my family after my cousin Zac passed away. We left OKC at 1:25, changed planes at DFW and arrived in Indy at 7:10. Joanna did great! <p>Before leaving OKC she was screaming, but after som tummy drops she calmed down and hardly made a peep the rest of the way. </p><p>Morgan did a great job helping her get through take-off and landing. He encouraged her to suck on her pacifier and massaged behind her ears. She didn't seem affected by the pressure changes at all. </p><p>I even got to change her in the plane bathroom, the fold down table worked just fine. Being short I can actually stand in there without ducking so that was helpful. </p><p>She sure attracts attention in the airport!  Even if she's not making a sound people see her and comment how cute she is or how much they like her red hair. It's pretty cool. </p><p>Hopefully the return flights Sunday will go just as well. </p><p>-Jessica</p></div>
