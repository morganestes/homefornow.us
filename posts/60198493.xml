	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I keep meaning to write this stuff down, but I don't take the time enough to do it, so here's the recap of the past couple of months, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>saw the baby, she'll be here in October!</li>
<li>felt the baby move</li>
<li>she moves A LOT. Sonogram tech said she "has personality".</li>
<li>learned "personality" is code for squirmy, so we get another one to finish what she couldn't measure the first time.</li>
<li>went to Vegas for a week-long getaway (thanks Uncle Father Tom!)</li>
<li>climbed <em>inside </em>the Hoover Dam &mdash; what a view!</li>
<li>enjoyed the first fruits (okay, vegetables) of our garden with our friends the Bailey's</li>
<li>that first zucchini was HUGE</li>
<li>went to physical therapy for back/neck problems. Better, but still a problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's more, and each of those could probably warrant their own post, but that's all for now I guess. I think I'll call that caught up and try to write as events happen.</p>
